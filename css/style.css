/* Step 1: animation */

/* Animate the logo with keyframes. (Here is a keyframes reference.) It should start at a width of 25px and grow to 475px.  It should also start with an opacity of 0 and end with an opacity of 1. The animation should take 5 seconds and only happen when the page is loaded. **You can complete this step later in the process - it won’t affect the larger views.  */

#logo {
    animation: logo; 
    animation-duration: 5s; 
}

@keyframes logo {
    from {width: 25px} 
    to {width: 475px} 

    from {opacity: 0;} 
    to {opacity: 1;}
}

/* Step 2: Default mode */

/* Edit the body element to use the Poppins font (using Google fonts) with serif as a backup.  It should also use the image “concrete_seamless.png” as a background-image with a backup color of #f1f1f1. */

body {
    font-family: 'Poppins', serif; 
    /* for font family, unless it's multiple words, you don't need quotation marks. but since we are pulling in an external font through, we use quotation marks to show that this is where you are going to be pulling it from  */ 

    background-image: url('../images/concrete_seamless.png'); 
    /* the .. is saying that you might have to go out of the folder and into another folder to get the images */

    background-color: #f1f1f1;

    /* background: url(../images/concrete_seamless.png), #f1f1f1;  */
    /* this also works ^  */ 
}

/* Step 3: edit css for header */ 

/* Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) to use flex to match our example. */ 

header {
    display: flex; 
    flex-direction: column; 
    align-items: center; 
}

/* Step 4: edit css for nav_links */ 

/* Edit the css for the nav_links class to use flex to match our example. Do not modify the list items or the links - modify the nav_links class to use flex.  */

.nav_links {
    display: flex; 
    flex-direction: column; 
}

/* Step 5: style the links  */ 

/* Style the links so that they have the same color even after they have been visited. */ 

.nav_item:link, .nav_item:visited {
    text-decoration: none;
    /* background-color: transparent;  */
    color: blue; 
}

/* Step 6: style direct children 

Identify the proper selector to style ONLY those header elements that are direct children of a card class.  The required styling is the following: 
a. background: #288088,
b. solid 2px border using #45ADAD,
c. 20px of padding on the top and the bottom, 
d. 50px border-radius on the top left and right corners.  */ 

.card > header {
    background-color: #288088; 
    border: solid 2px #45ADAD; 
    padding-top: 20px; 
    padding-bottom: 20px; 
    border-radius: 50px 50px 0px 0px;
}

.card {
    border-radius: 50px 50px 0px 0px;
}

/* Step 7: edit css card class */ 

/* Edit the css for the card class to match our example. Achieve this by using a flex-property to specify an initial “size” of 450px.  You need to think about this from a “flex” perspective and realize that flex-direction will affect the size of the elements.  You can see that in the mobile view they all have the same width.  */

.card {
    display: flex; 
    flex-basis: 450px; 
    flex-direction: column;
}

/* Step 8: edit css pricing class  */

/* Edit the css for the pricing class to match our example. You should use flex and the cards should be centered both horizontally and vertically. */ 

.pricing {
    justify-content: center; 
    align-items: center;
}

/* Step 9: style images in gallery class  */

/* Style the images in the gallery class. These elements will have a solid 10px border with a color of #50C7C7, 10px margin on all four sides and a width of 300px.   */

#image1, #image2, #image3, #image4, #image5 {
    border: solid 10px #50C7C7; 
    margin: 10px; 
    width: 300px;

}

/* Step 10: edit css for gallery class  */

/* Edit the css for the gallery class to use flex to match our example. (You may want to look at the screen shots from 1200px and 1500px as well -  the changes are not from media queries, but from the use of flex.) */ 

.gallery {
    display: flex; 
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: row; 
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

/* The following specifications are for when the screen-size is greater than 900px
Observe the screenshot from from 1200px */

/* Step 11: edit css for header and nav  */

/* Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) and the nav_links class to match our example using flex-properties. The logo should be as far to the left as possible and the links as far to the right as possible. Use flex properties, NOT position properties. */ 

@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {
    .header {
        display: flex; 
        flex-direction: row; 
        flex-wrap: nowrap;
        justify-content: normal;
        align-items: flex-start; 
    }
    #logo {
        display: flex; 
        flex-direction: row; 
        justify-content: flex-start; 
        align-items: center; 
    }
    .nav_links { 
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: row;
        justify-content: flex-end;
        align-content: flex-end;
        align-items: center;
     
    }
}

/* Step 12: edit css for pricing and card  */

/* Edit the css for the pricing and card classes to match our example. Part of achieving this is by using a flex-property to specify a “size” of 275px. Notice that the elements do not have the same height, but do have the same width. */

@media screen and (min-width: 900px) {
    /* .pricing {
        flex-basis: 275px;
    } */

    .card {
        display: flex;
        flex-basis: 275px;
    }
}

/* Step 13: modify first header  */

/* Modify the first header (the one not inside main) so that it remains visible at the top of the screen even as we scroll down. Make sure that it is always visible. You can see an example of this in the video and in the screenshot at 1200px when scrolled*(image updated 2/21/23). This is a challenge problem. You should not give or receive help when completing it. */



/* The following specifications are for when the user prefers reduced motion.   */

/* Step 14: reduced motion  */

/* The logo class should appear but not be animated if prefers-reduced-motion is selected in the accessibility preferences.  */

@media (prefers-reduced-motion) {
    #logo {
        animation-duration: 0s;
    }
  } 

/* The following specifications are for when the page is printed in portrait mode. */


/* Step 15: Change the font on your body to Arial with a backup value of  Helvetica */
@media screen and (orientation: portrait) {
    .body {
        font-family: Arial, Helvetica;
    }
}

/* Step 16: The background image should be removed.  */
@media screen and (orientation: portrait) {
    .body { 
        background-image: none;
    }
}

/* Step 17: Edit the nav/nav_links elements so that they are spaced according to the image above. */

@media screen and (orientation: portrait) {
    .nav_item:link {
        justify-content: space-between;
    }
}

/* Step 18: Edit the pricing class so that the elements align along the bottom.  As long as it aligns along the bottom we don't care if the cards aren't the same height. */

@media screen and (orientation: portrait) {
    .pricing {
        display: flex; 
        align-items: flex-end;
    }
}

/* Step 19: The card elements should have a solid border 2px of #45ADDD and use flex-basis of 325px.  */
@media screen and (orientation: portrait) {
    .card {
        border: solid 2px #45ADDD; 
        flex-basis: 325px; 
    }
}

/* Step 20: No part of the gallery should be visible. */

@media screen and (orientation: portrait) {
    .gallery {
        visibility: hidden;
    }
}

/* Step 21: Without using list-style-type add the thumbs up entity as shown in the cards. This is a challenge problem. You should not give or receive help when completing it.**For some people the thumbs up is not printing as yellow. That is fine. */
